A Note on the Music

    Welcome to my music collection! The playlist you're hearing is a mix of my own original songs and unique pieces created with the help of AI music tools.

    The tracks I wrote myself are my personal compositions. The "generated" tracks are fun experiments in digital sound, used here under the creative licenses provided by the AI services.

 Everything is shared here for the simple joy of music and is not for commercial use. If you have any questions or believe there's an issue with any of the content, please don't hesitate to reach out. I respect all artists and creators and will address any concerns right away.
